# Skyscraper solver in z3

Largely based on the Z3 Sudoku example in the z3 docs at
https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/blob/master/examples/java/JavaExample.java#L489

Rules at https://www.gmpuzzles.com/blog/skyscrapers-rules-and-info/รก

## Setup

Download z3 binaries from https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases
Put all the files from `bin/` in that zip into `lib/`

You may need to manually add the `lib/` dir to the PATH env var when running the app.
